# Wolf genomics
A project in the RaukR course

The goal of this project is to rewrite old bash code fully in R. The old code extracted genotype counts for each individual in a vcf file (polarized using two outgroups), which was plotted using a base R script. 
The new code will use tidyverse and ggplot.
